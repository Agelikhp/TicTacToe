# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Java, where two players take turns to place their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner after each move and handles cases of draw and invalid moves.

## Features

- Two players can play the game by entering their moves.
- The game checks for a win condition after each move.
- The game checks for a draw condition if the board is full.
- Invalid moves (such as placing a mark in an already occupied cell) are handled gracefully.

## How to Run the Game

1. **Clone the repository** or download the `TicTacToe.java` file.
2. **Compile the Java file** using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac TicTacToe.java
